# NHANES-Poverty-Health-Analysis

Final project for UCSD course COGS108 (Data Science in Practice). Used the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey data to explore how one's income ratio to the poverty level affects their health. Overall, we found no significant difference between high income individuals and low income individual when looking at health factors related to nutrition.
